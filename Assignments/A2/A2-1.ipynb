    "Data scientists often spend 80% of their time on [data preparation](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3228245/the-80-20-data-science-dilemma.html). If your career goal is to become a data scientist, you have to master data cleaning and data integration skills. In this assignment, you will learn how to solve the Entity Resolution (ER) problem, a very common problem in data cleaning and integration. After completing this assignment, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n",

    "1. What is ER?\n",
    "2. What are the applications of ER in data integration and cleaning? \n",

    "5. How to evaluate an ER result?\n",

In this assignment, you will learn how to apply ER in a data integration setting.

    "To implement similarity join, you need to address the following challenges:\n",

    "1. Jaccard is used to quantify the similarity between two sets instead of two records. You need to convert each record to a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A naive implementation of similarity join is to compute Jaccard for all $|R \\times S|$ possible pairs. Imagine R and S have one million records. This requires doing 10^12 pair comparisons, which is extremely expensive. Thus, you need to know how to avoid n^2 comparisons. \n",

    "How should we evaluate an ER result? Before answering this question, let's first recall what the ER result looks like. The goal of ER is to identify all matching record pairs. Thus, the ER result should be a set of identified matching pairs, denoted by R. One thing that we want to know is that what percentage of the pairs in $R$ that are truly matching? This is what Precision can tell us. Let $T$ denote the truly matching pairs in $R$. Precision is defined as:\n",
    "$$Precision = \\frac{|T|}{|R|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to Precision, another thing that we care about is that what percentage of truly matching pairs that are identified. This is what Recall can tell us. Let $A$ denote the truly matching pairs in the entire dataset. Recall is defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Recall = \\frac{|T|}{|A|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an interesting trade-off between Precision and Recall. As more and more pairs that are identified as matching, Recall increases while Precision potentially decreases. For the extreme case, if we return all the pairs as matching pairs, we will get a perfect Recall (i.e., Recall = 100%) but precision will be the worst. Thus, to balance Precision and Recall, people often use FMeasure to evaluate an ER result:\n",
